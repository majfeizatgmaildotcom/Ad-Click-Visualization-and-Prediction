## Project Objective
In the new era of the internet, marketing drastically changed, and companies extensively use the internet for advertising their product. However, it is crucial to target the right audience to manage the cost of the advertisements. Targeting the right audience via online marketing possesses many challenges. It is vital to have a detailed analysis to promote the product to the right customers efficiently and effectively to manage the cost.

In this project, the advertising marketing data is used to provide a detailed exploratory statistical and Geo-map analysis and provide a model predication based on the feature in the data such as, 'Age', 'Area Income', 'Daily Internet Usage', 'Ad Topic Line', 'City', 'Country', Gender, and if the user 'Clicked on Ad' or not.
The variable of interest is 'Clicked on Ad' with two possible outcomes: 0 and 1, where 0 refers to the case where a user did not click the advertisement, while one refers to the cases where a user clicks the ad.
